# Aerosols over Cryosphere
Quantifying aerosol presence and composition over Earth's ice sheets and glaciers - mapping anthropogenic and natural aerosol patters and estimating changes over time

# Description
Many of Earth’s glaciers have been losing mass at an alarming rate in the past few decades. Both anthropogenic and natural aerosols deposited on snow and ice can darken reflective surfaces, increase solar absorption and subsequently enhance snow and ice melt rates. This project seeks to map aerosols over Earth's cryosphere using the global land ice identification mask and monthly mean MERRA-2 aerosol data. Ideally, the project will be completed for all of Earth, mapping aerosol concentrations, with seasonal and annual totals from 1980-present. If time/space limits us, the project can be reduced geographically (e.g. Arctic or Himalaya) and temporally (2000-present).

# Input data:
[Randolph Glacier Inventory](http://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html), RGI 5.0, shapefile, vector format, delineates the spatial extent of Earth’s glaciers.
file size: whole inventory 410 mb zipped
739 MB unzipped, 125 files, organized by 19 regions

MERRA-2 aerosol raster [data](http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/data_access/). Input data consists of monthly mean dust, organic carbon, black carbon, sea salt and sulfate aerosol concentrations.

NetCDF-4 file
File sizes ~155 MB per monthly mean file.

MODIS, Aqua, Collection 6, 8-day surface reflectance raster data, to be collected coinciding with season or year corresponding to aerosol data.

or http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLA/MYD09A1.006/
File size ~80 MB per tile, all 7 spectral bands, one tile. 460 tiles to cover Earth, tiles are 10 degrees by 10 degrees at the equator (http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html).

If time allows, desire to add land ice surface reflectance values from Landsat (all mountain, peninsula, coastal glaciers) for smaller glaciers.  Reflectance data will be collected to coincide with measured aerosol season or year (e.g. spring or annual).
