-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Launcher: a simple utility for submitting multiple 
          serial applications simultaneously. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use:

  * Set LAUNCHER_JOB_FILE to point to your job file. Example job files
    are provided in extras/examples.

  * Be sure that LAUNCHER_DIR is set to the directory containing the 
    launcher source files (user-installed ONLY. Not required if using
    system installed version of launcher).

  * From the command-line or within your jobscript, run:
    $LAUNCHER_DIR/paramrun

Available Environment Variables:

  You should set the following environment variables:

    * $LAUNCHER_JOB_FILE is the file containing the jobs to run in your parametric 
      submission.

    * $LAUNCHER_WORKDIR is the directory where the launcher will execute. 
      All relative paths will resolve to this directory.

  The launcher defines the following environment variables for each job 
  that is started:

    * $LAUNCHER_NPROCS contains the number of processes running 
      simultaneously in your parametric submission.

    * $LAUNCHER_NHOSTS contains the number of hosts running
      simultaneously in your parametric submission.

    * $LAUNCHER_PPN contains the number of processes per node.

    * $LAUNCHER_NJOBS contains the number of jobs in your paramfile.

    * $LAUNCHER_TSK_ID is the particular processing core that the job is 
      running on, from 0 to $LAUNCHER_NPROCS-1.

    * $LAUNCHER_JID represents the particular job instance currently 
      running. $LAUNCHER_JID is numbered from 1 to $LAUNCHER_NJOBS.

  Example: If you want to redirect stdout to a file containing the unique ID
  of each line, you can specify the following in the paramlist file:
    a.out > out.o$LAUNCHER_JID
  If this particular execution instance of a.out was the first line in the
  paramlist file, the output would be placed in the file "out.o1".

  Note: you can also use the launcher to run a sequence of serial
  jobs when you have more jobs to run than the requested number of
  processors.  

Task Scheduling Behavior:

  The launcher has three available behaviors for scheduling jobs, available
  by setting the environment variable $LAUNCHER_SCHED:
  (descriptions below assume k = task, p = num. procs, n = num. jobs)

    * dynamic (default) - each task k executes first available unclaimed line
    * interleaved - each task k executes every (k+p)th line
    * block - each task k executes lines [ k(n/p)+1, (k+1)(n/p) ]

Using the launcher with Intel Xeon Phi cards:

  The launcher has the ability to execute appropriately compiled executables
  natively on Intel Xeon Phi (MIC) cards.

  Available Environment Variables for Intel Xeon Phi execution:

    * $LAUNCHER_NPHI is the number of Intel Xeon Phi cards per node.
      This is set to zero (0) by default. Acceptable values are '1' and '2'.

    * $LAUNCHER_PHI_PPN is the number of processes per Intel Xeon Phi card.

    * $LAUNCHER_PHI_JOB_FILE is the file containing the jobs to run on the 
      Intel Xeon Phi cards. 

Job Submission:

  Copy the example job submission script "launcher.<sched>" to your
  working directory to use as a starting point for interfacing with
  the desired batch system. Note that this script provides some simple
  error checking prior to the actual submission to aid in diagnosing
  missing executables and misconfiguration.

  The directory containing this README contains several example submission
  scripts:

	SGE:   launcher.sge
        SLURM: launcher.slurm
